### **_Description_**

#### This project is an online Connect Four game, a two-player game designed to be played using a six-row by seven-column grid. The game's objective is to win by being the first player to have four game pieces connected in a row, column, or diagonal line. The game is played from the bottom row up, with each player alternating turns and selecting an empty space. A player can only occupy an empty space if it is on the first row or above an occupied space. A player cannot select a space that has an open space directly below it. Lastly, the game is a draw if there is no winner by the time the board fills up.
